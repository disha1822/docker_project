# Docker Project : Two Tier Architecture

## Introduction
I have finished docker training under **IIEC-RISE 1.0** under the mentorship of **Vimal Daga Sir** and this is a final project 
about how we can use docker to implement **Multi Tier Architecture**.
In this particular example I have made a **Two Tier Architecture** having
  * 1. Web Tier : It is the Front end and can be accessed openly through the internet
                  Softwares used : Apache and PHP            
  * 2. Database Tier : A dynamic website requires a database support and it can be accessed through the web server only.
                  Software used : MySQL
I have built this in a **Single Server Architecture**
